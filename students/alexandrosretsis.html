            <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
        </center>Been lucky enough to grow up at the lovely island of Corfu, Greece (and with great parents always giving me the best! Thanks) i had the opurtunity to explore all these years many different interesting activities as hobbies.
        <p>Paragliding, skying (not in Corfu!!!), off road quad bike rides. motorbike driving lessons, martial art, horse riding, bike scrambling and music, are only a few of them!</p>


        <p> Site developing teqniques include lots basic and tedious html tags,a couple of javascript teqniques and many .css files! </p>
