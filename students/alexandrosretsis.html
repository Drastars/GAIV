        <p>TAGS USED</p>
                
                <ul class="tags-list">
                    
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>Asside the most common tags, special tags i used in my page as follows:</p>
                    
                    <li>&lt;Footer&gt; tag! This was used to highlight information at the begining or end of a page/s.</li><br><li>&lt;span&gt; tag! this was used to style and group elements, instead of the classic div tag, the only difference really is that the span is an inline element. </li><br>
                    <li>&lt;section&gt; tag! This was used to define and seperate different sections in my pages.  </li><br>
                    <li>&lt;nav&gt; tag! This was used to create the navigation bar for this personal page only, whereas in the index page a &lt;ul&gt; tag was used for the navbar.</li><br>
                    <li>&lt;script&gt; tag! we used this not only to import special fonts, but also to to write and implement java script code for the enrichment of our page</li><br>
                    <li>And lastly the &lt;button&gt; tag! although its quite simple to use, its also very effective if used right, we used this to make clickable buttons that link to other areas of our website.</li><br>
                    <li>More analytic and specific descriptions for some of the pages can be found within the html code itself in the form of comments.</li>
        </ul>
